# Testing Stuff

This folder contains Jest and manual test files

## Jest Test Files
Jest test files contain *.test.* in the filenames

Run with **npm run test** -or- **npm run testWatch**. It is left to the reader to understand the difference between the two Jest commands

## Manual Test Files
Files I used to test and debug as I built portions of the package. *workingFolder.js* is more-or-less the *run everything* test file

Run these tests using **node <path/to/file>/<filename>.js

## Test Repos
I created to simple Remote and Working repos to rune Jest and Manual tests against. GitHub won't allow repos inside of a repo, so I zipped them up

zz_TestingRepos.zip should be expanded before testing. It will create a folder called zz_TestRepos that contains Remote, Working, and fake repos for testing
